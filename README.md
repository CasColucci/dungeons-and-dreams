# Dungeons and Dreams
Some kind of dungeons and dragons tool, potentially. I'm not completely sure what this is or what it will be but with any luck it'll be something nice. 

# What is this?
Ha, that presumes I know. 

Alright, so I sort of know. I had two issues: I wasn't contributing anything that could be notable online and I wanted to do something that involved Dungeons and Dragons. This may not necessarily be "notable" but it IS related to dungeons and dragons. 

# But nothing's here!
That's because I haven't done anything yet. Please come back at a later date

# Alright but you didn't answer what this is
I don't quite know yet. I have specific ideas in mind for a D&D tool for DM's and players but at this time I haven't settled on anything. I intend to get the groundwork down first and then maybe later I can tell you. 

# You aren't using/doing this right
Probably not. I have very little experience with Github outside of private repositories for little projects or school-related tasks and a hundred articles or videos on the subject as well as tons of lurking along the edges of other repos. A lot of things here seem to come just from experience, and, like how it's hard to explain to someone playing a multiplayer game for the first time all the shorthand used or taboo tactics, I simply am not there yet. I'm trying, and any suggestions would be much appreciated.
