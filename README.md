# dungeons-and-dreams
Some kind of dungeons and dragons tool, potentially. I'm not completely sure what this is or what it will be but with any luck it'll be something nice. 

# What is this?
Ha, that presumes I know. 

Alright, so I sort of know. I had two issues: I wasn't contributing anything that could be notable online and I wanted to do something that involved Dungeons and Dragons. This may not necessarily be "notable" but it IS related to dungeons and dragons. 

# But nothing's here!
That's because I haven't done anything yet. Please come back at a later date

# Alright but you didn't answer what this is
I don't quite know yet. I have specific ideas in mind for a D&D tool for DM's and players but at this time I haven't settled on anything. I intend to get the groundwork down first and then maybe later I can tell you.
